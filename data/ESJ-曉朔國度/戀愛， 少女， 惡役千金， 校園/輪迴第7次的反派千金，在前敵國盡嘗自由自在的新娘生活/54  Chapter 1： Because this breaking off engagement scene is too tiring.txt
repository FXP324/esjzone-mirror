"Rishe Ilmgard Wertsner! You're such a vicious woman to be this sovereign crown prince's fiancee. Right this very minute, I'm breaking off my engagement with you!"
"Okay, I understand."
"Huh."
Despite the dismay of her former fiance, the Crown Prince, the young lady Rishe bowed.
It's a dignified elegant salutation that fascinated the guests around them. 
The Crown Prince was dumbfounded, but still shouted in haste.
"Wait, wait! You agree to calling off the engagement!? Are you not worried about how you'll be treated after this!?"
"No, it'll be fine."
She knows very well how she'll be treated when the word spreads out. 
Various defamation will pile up on Rishe's head she'd be sentenced to exile. She'd be cut off her family has to live alone.
(Because, this is the seventh time now.)
This was not the first time Rishe had gone through the same ordeal.
(I'd better get busy now. If I don't pack my luggage up when the news reaches my mother father's ears, there'd be no chance I'd get into the house. I had failed to do so on the first third time, so ended up desperate in starting all over again.)
"Oh, hey! Wait, listen up! I'll think for a week the charges against you will be read out!"
(Oh, right! I need to pack up some dresses. I also need to bring some things related to my occupation in this life. I wonder if I still can do so by the time I get home here. Oh, time is running out! If only I could rewind time in anyway, I hope there's still enough time left!)
"Hold on ~, wait~, Rishe!"
The guests around couldn't resist convulsing into laughter at the Crown Prince, who is on the verge of dissolving in tears.
Rishe was suddenly reminded of something looked back. 
"I forgot to tell you something important, Your Highness."
"Uh-huh, yeah, that should be! If you have any words of regret…"
"No, that's not the case."
It was but a slip of the tongue, whatever.  Having been abandoned the seventh time, there's no way she’s going to have second thoughts.
And so, she smiled.
"Be happy with Marie. Have a good life together."
"What…?!"
Rishe started walking while flipping her ball gown. 
"Huh, what, uhh, I haven't said anything about it yet, my beloved woman is Marie…!?"
Rishe ignored the shouting behind her, she's really busy now. She was so upset the first time that she launched objections to protect herself, but now, she's been schooled that she'd only be getting ridiculous answers.
(More than that, I'm so excited. I wonder what my life would be this time around.)
Looking back to her 6 past lives, Rishe laughed.
(Every life had been a lot of fun fulfilling…. but this time. In this lifetime, I want to live longer live life freely!)
To do that — she, must ensure that she won't be killed anymore.
