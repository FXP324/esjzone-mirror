（在教皇的辦公室裡...）

「關於F的資料查出來了吶？」

在辦公室中，教皇：艾因拉爾哈薩克•萊爾•雷締曼拉斯(以下簡稱艾茵)，正焦急的不停詢問著部下。

因為昨天突然出現的F那異常的實力，艾茵不敢輕忽他，那已經是超越系統等級的對手了，艾茵幾乎可以確定，他是系統外的存在。

也正因為如此，艾茵希望可以收集到F的情報，不管多或少，只要有一絲線索，以自己的搜索能力應該就可以得知對方的真實身分。

「報告，教皇大人，一部分的資料是查到了，但是...」

「沒差沒差，快點給我看吶！」

「是...是！」

艾茵馬上從部下手中拿到報告，並開始仔細地查看。

過了一陣子…艾茵慢慢的把報告書放下。

現場的所有部下都因為艾茵的氣氛而不敢說話，現場瀰漫著難以形容的沉重氣氛。
過了一會，艾茵長嘆了一口氣。

「不可能吶...」

艾茵臉上從不可置信轉變為恐懼，幾十年沒感覺到恐懼的他，已經快忘了恐懼的感覺。但是，這一次，恐懼深深的植入了艾茵的心中。

「那位傳說中的管理員大人居然開始行動了吶...」

嗚...
這是...哪裡？
我記得...我確實見到歐尼醬了。
我四處看看，發現我在一張非常、非常、非常豪華的床上，四周有著非常、非常、非常豪華的各種擺設。
我剛想爬起來，突然，一陣聲音傳來。

「霞大人，您醒了嗎？」

哇！誰啊！
我快速的轉向聲音來的方向。
站在那裡的是一名幼女，頭上長著兩隻狐耳，有著紅髮、金眼，可以看到她的後方有一條狐狸尾巴不停的搖擺著，還、還穿著女僕裝。
好、好...

「好可愛！」

「等等，欸！」

抱住她！瘋狂的摸尾巴！

「等等！嗚！請...請放開咱...啊！」
